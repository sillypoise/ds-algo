# Data Structures and Algorithms

A personal repo used to store answers to different data-structures and algorithm prompts.

I try to revisit problems I have found solutions for, add new problems and add solutions in different langauges. It serves as a place to not only store solutions but problems themselves.

As of now it's mostly TypeScript solutions. But slowly try to add new languages.
